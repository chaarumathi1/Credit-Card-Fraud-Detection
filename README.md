# Credit Card Fraud Detection
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. With the rising number of online transactions, detecting anomalies and preventing financial fraud has become critical. This model helps in identifying suspicious transaction patterns based on historical data.
## Project Overview
•	Dataset:  The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions with features transformed via PCA for confidentiality. It includes both normal and fraudulent transactions.

•	Goal:  Classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using various machine learning models and evaluate their performance.
##  Methods Used
•	Data Preprocessing:

•	Data cleaning and scaling

•	Handling class imbalance using SMOTE

•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

•	Transaction amount distribution

•	Fraud ratio

•	Machine Learning Models:

•	Logistic Regression

•	Random Forest

•	XGBoost

•	Evaluation Metrics:

•	Confusion Matrix

•	Precision, Recall, F1-Score

•	ROC-AUC Score
##  Key Highlights
•	Used imbalanced-learn techniques to handle skewed data.

•	Achieved better fraud detection using ensemble methods.

•	Visualized model performance using graphs and charts.

•	Optimized for both accuracy and recall to reduce false negatives.
